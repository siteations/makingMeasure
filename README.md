Data and d3 viz tools for an 1850s Dictionary of Measures (HTML, JS, d3.js)

Making Measure turns visualizes instrumental abstractions, using d3 and basic DOM selection/manipulation for an alternate lens onto the evolving structures of metrology. Offering animations, excavations, and an anthropology (of sorts) it literally draws out the units in J.H. Alexander's Universal Dictionary of Weights and Measures (1850).

Collated at a moment of intense industrialization, urbanization, and globalization, Alexander's Dictionary is typical of 19th century quests to classify and compile. With over 5000 units ('antique and modern'), it catalogues measures by geography of use, materials handled, and imperial conversion. Its biggish data provides an interesting window onto:
* commercial and cultural ambitions (ancient greek conversions),
* metropolitan transfers and territories (tribal/colonial/hybrid metrics),
* and, the particular intensity of cultural contacts (minute variations listed port by port as a glimpse of alternate histories, tools, terrains).

The Dictionary visualization lets viewers browse the Dictionary's units by type (liquid, length, etc.). With weighted summations by port, it can be explored to draw out relative sizes of units used and their shared cities of deployment (as detailed in Alexander's condensed colonial histories). The dashboard display, for each unit, provides a quick, visual overview of: 
* relative conversions within the english system, 
* the common sites of usage as classified with empire, alliance, and material variation
* as well as original jpg of archival dictionary scans and, eventually, Alexander's final summary of the politics of shipping.
